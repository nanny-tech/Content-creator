## Vision

The "Royalties Distribution for Content Creators" project is designed to create a fair, transparent, and automated method for distributing royalties to content creators. By leveraging blockchain technology, this smart contract ensures that all creators receive their rightful share of earnings without the need for intermediaries. Our goal is to empower creators by providing a decentralized and trustless solution for managing and distributing royalties.

## Smart Contract Address

- **Network**: Ethereum Mainnet (or your preferred testnet)
- **Contract Address**: `[0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138]`

---

## Features

- **Automated Royalty Distribution**: Automatically allocates incoming payments to content creators based on their predefined percentages.
- **Easy Creator Management**: Easily add or modify creators and their royalty percentages through simple function calls.
- **Transparency and Security**: All transactions are securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing tampering.
- **No Intermediaries**: Direct payment to creators without any third-party involvement, reducing delays and costs.

## How It Works

1. **Add Creators**: Use the `addCreator` function to register a new content creator and specify their royalty percentage.
   
2. **Payment Reception**: Whenever the contract receives ETH, the payment is automatically distributed to all registered creators.

3. **Royalty Distribution**: Each creator receives their share of the payment based on the percentage set during registration.

4. **Transaction Logging**: Every royalty distribution is logged and can be tracked on the blockchain.

## Future Scope

- **Support for Multiple Currencies**: Implement support for distributing royalties in multiple cryptocurrencies, including ERC-20 tokens.
- **Dynamic Percentage Adjustment**: Introduce mechanisms for dynamically adjusting royalty percentages based on predefined criteria.
- **User Interface**: Develop a web-based interface for easier interaction with the contract, including adding creators and tracking payments.
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Explore integration with other blockchains to support cross-chain royalty distribution.
